        in the Tournament activity and any accompanying materials, to use, display, publish, transmit, copy, edit,
        alter, store, re-format and sub-licence the Tournament activity and any accompanying materials for such

      <p>12.1 - If there is any reason to believe that there has been a breach of these Terms, Hutch may, at its sole
        discretion, reserve the right to exclude you from participating in the Tournament.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>12.2 - Hutch reserves the right to hold void, suspend, cancel, or amend the Tournament where it becomes
        necessary to do so, including if any law or regulation is inconsistent with these Terms or where any law or
        regulation makes Hutch&rsquo;s performance of these Terms impossible, unlawful, illegal or unethical.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>12.3 - These Terms shall be construed in accordance with and be governed by the laws of England and Wales. Each
        party to these Terms irrevocably agrees that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction
        to settle any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection
        with these Terms or its subject matter or formation.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>12.4 - FOR U.S. AND CANADIAN RESIDENTS ONLY: This clause 12.4 applies only to users who reside in the U.S. or
        Canada, and offers a streamlined way to resolve disputes between you and us if they arise. Most of your concerns
        can be resolved by contacting customer service at <a href="mailto:community@hutchgames.com"
          rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">community@hutchgames.com</a>. If we cannot resolve your concern, you and we
        agree to be bound by the procedure set forth in this clause to resolve any and all disputes between us. PLEASE
        READ THIS CLAUSE CAREFULLY. IT PROVIDES THAT YOU AND WE ARE AGREEING TO RESOLVE MOST DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING
        INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION INSTEAD OF COURT TRIALS AND CLASS ACTIONS.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>12.4.1 - Claims Covered by Arbitration: All Disputes shall be determined exclusively by binding arbitration.
        The term "Dispute" is intended to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. If you have a
        Dispute that cannot be resolved through negotiation within the time frame described in the "Notice of Dispute"
        clause below, you and we agree to seek resolution of the Dispute only through arbitration of that Dispute in
        accordance with the terms of this clause, and not litigate any Dispute in court, except for those matters listed
        in the Exclusions from Arbitration clause. Arbitration means that the Dispute will be resolved by a neutral
        arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury. Your agreement to arbitrate survives your, or our,
        termination of your access to the Services.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>12.4.2 - Exclusions from Arbitration: You and we each agree that the following causes of action and/or claims
        for relief are exceptions to the Disputes covered by the arbitration agreement and will be brought in a judicial
        proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction (as outlined in this arbitration agreement): (i) any claim or
        cause of action alleging actual or threatened regarding the infringement, protection or validity of your, our or
        our licensors' intellectual property, trade secrets or copyright, trademark or patent rights; (ii) any claim or
        cause of action seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or
        commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack); or (iii) a request for the remedy of public injunctive relief,
        where such remedies are permitted and cannot be waived by applicable law. In addition, to the extent your claim
        or Dispute qualifies under applicable law, you may elect to proceed in small claims court.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>12.4.3 - Opt-Out Right: YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION AND THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER WITHIN
        30 DAYS. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN THIS CLAUSE, YOU
        MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT, OR ANYONE ACTING ON YOUR BEHALF ACCEPTS,
        THIS AGREEMENT UNLESS A LONGER PERIOD IS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW (the "<strong>Opt-Out Deadline</strong>").
        YOU MAY OPT-OUT OF THE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES OUTLINED IN THIS CLAUSE BY EMAIL TO <a
          href="mailto:legal@hutchgames.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">legal@hutchgames.com</a> WITH THE
        SUBJECT LINE "Terms of Use &ndash; Opt-Out Notice." YOUR WRITTEN NOTICE MUST INCLUDE: (1) YOUR PLAYER ID, (2)
        YOUR NAME, (3) YOUR ADDRESS, (4) THE EMAIL ADDRESS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR APP STORE OR HUTCH STORE ACCOUNT, IF YOU
        HAVE ONE, AND (5) A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH HUTCH THROUGH
        ARBITRATION.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In order to validly terminate the arbitration agreement, we must receive your opt out notice no later than 3
        days after the Opt-Out Deadline for it to be valid. You agree that you must pursue any claim in arbitration or
        small claims court if we do not receive an opt-out notice from you, or if we receive an opt-out notice from you
        more than 3 days after the Opt-Out Deadline.</p>
      <p>12.4.4 - Notice of Dispute: If you have a Dispute with us, or any of our affiliates, you must send a written
        notice to <a href="mailto:legal@hutchgames.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">legal@hutchgames.com</a>,
        with the subject line "Notice of Dispute". The informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice
        from one person to the other ("<strong>Notice of Dispute</strong>"). The Notice of Dispute must: (a) include the
        full name and contact information of the complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or
        dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (together, the "<strong>Required Information</strong>").
        If your notice does not contain all of the Required Information (or an explanation of why you are unable to
        include any of the Required Information), then the Notice of Dispute shall be without effect, and must be resent
        before any arbitration or other legal action may be initiated. This requirement is intended to inform us that
        you have a Dispute to be resolved. We will send our Notice of Dispute to your email address. Most disputes are
        resolved by our customer service team but if for whatever reason they are not able to solve the issue, you will
        be provided an opportunity to escalate the matter first to our responsible management team member(s). You and we
        agree to attempt to resolve any Dispute informally, and in good faith, for at least 60 days after an effective
        Notice of Dispute is provided, before initiating arbitration pursuant to the terms of this clause.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>12.4.5 - Arbitration Procedure: If you and we cannot resolve a Dispute informally, subject to the exceptions in
        clause 12.4.2, you and we agree to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. The
        arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), unless the AAA declines or is
        unable, then Hutch will select an alternative arbitral forum.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>We agree that we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees other than the initial filing fee that
        you must pay to file the initial arbitration demand. If your Claim is for less than $1,000 we will reimburse you
        for the filing fee if you provide a written request for reimbursement with evidence of insufficient funds to pay
        the fee yourself. In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be
        prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, Hutch will pay as much of your filing fee in connection with the
        arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared
        to the costs of litigation. Otherwise, we will each bear the fees and expenses of our respective attorneys,
        experts, witnesses and preparation and presentation of evidence at the arbitration.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the AAA&rsquo;s rules, including the <a
          href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><u>AAA&rsquo;s Consumer Arbitration Rules</u></a>, respectively <a
          href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Supplementary_Rules_MultipleCase_Filings.pdf" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><u>the AAA's Supplementary Rules for Multiple Case Filings</u></a> (as
        applicable), as modified by these Terms. The AAA rules and information about arbitration and fees are available
        online at <a href="http://www.adr.org" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><u>www.adr.org</u></a> or by calling
        the AAA at 1-800-778- 7879. The arbitration will be conducted in English by one arbitrator, who will be
        appointed by the AAA. For Claims under $25,000, the arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the
        parties or witnesses but will instead be conducted based solely on written submissions, unless you or we request
        an in-person or telephonic hearing or the arbitrator determines that an in-person or telephonic appearance is
        required. In the case of a hearing, the presumption shall be in favour of a virtual hearing, unless the
        arbitrator determines that a party&rsquo;s right to a fundamentally fair process would be impaired without an
        in-person hearing. In the case of an in-person hearing, the hearing shall be conducted in a mutually convenient
        location. Hutch will ordinarily request that the hearing be held in London, United Kingdom. You may petition the
        arbitrator to select an alternative location for the hearing. The arbitrator&rsquo;s selection of a hearing
        location shall be final and binding. You agree that in the event of an in-person hearing, any Hutch employee or
        affiliate who is based outside of the United States and who is participating in the hearing may participate by
        telephone or video conference, and their physical presence will not be required.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Any arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of
        any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award.
        Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Ordinarily, pre-hearing information exchange will be limited to the reasonable production of non-privileged
        documents directly relevant to the dispute. Unless the arbitrator determines that an additional form of
        information exchange is necessary to provide for a fundamentally fair process, those documents will be limited
        to your game play data and in-app purchases and communications directly about that information among you and
        Hutch. Any issues regarding discovery, or the relevance or scope thereof, will be determined by the arbitrator,
        and the arbitrator&rsquo;s determination will be conclusive.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The arbitrator will have the power to grant declaratory or injunctive relief, whether interim or final, only in
        favour of you individually and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by your individual claim
        without affecting other Hutch customers, and any provisional measures ordered by the arbitrator may be enforced
        by any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall make a decision in writing, and shall provide a
        statement of reasons if requested by either party. Nothing in these Terms will prevent you from seeking public
        injunctive relief separately from arbitration in court pursuant to these Terms, and any such application will
        not be deemed incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate or as a waiver of the right to arbitrate your
        individual claims. You and Hutch agree that any proceedings seeking a remedy of public injunctive relief will
        proceed after the arbitration of all arbitrable Claims, remedies, or causes of action, and will be stayed
        pending the outcome of the arbitration pursuant to section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>12.4.6 - Class Action Waiver: In addition to the above, YOU AND WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDING, WHETHER IN
        ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR
        REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, EXCEPT FOR ACTIONS FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AS DESCRIBED BELOW AND IN THIS PARAGRAPH. Upon
        motion of one or more interested parties, and after providing all other interested parties an opportunity to be
        heard, the arbitrator may, at their discretion, coordinate more than one arbitration proceeding initiated under
        this arbitration agreement, in order to promote efficiency in discovery and to avoid inconsistent legal rulings.
        In the interest of clarity, any coordination under the preceding sentence will be limited only to currently
        pending arbitrations initiated under this arbitration agreement, and the arbitrator may not preside over any
        form of a representative or class proceeding. All parties will retain the right to request an individualized
        hearing.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>If a court or arbitrator determines, in an action between you and us, that this class action waiver is
        unenforceable, this arbitration agreement will not apply to you. If you opt out of the arbitration agreement as
        specified above, this class action waiver will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other customer, can be a
        class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated or representative
        proceeding without having complied with the opt-out procedure set forth above.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>12.4.7 - Jury Waiver: IF FOR ANY REASON A DISPUTE PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE
        EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.&nbsp;</p>
